# üñ•Ô∏èPC Assemble (Quiz)

I personally enjoyed the process as I think it was fun to experience PC assemble with hands-on. It enables me to understand and remember faster than just studying the theory. It is really statisfying when seeing the PC that we assembled is able to work.

# üí°Design Thinking (Low Fidelity Prototype)

I think I have gained a lot through this project. Obviously, I learned what design thinking is. This will be really helpful for me in the future whenever I want to design or develop a product. Besides, I also learned to cooperate with others. My leadership and teamwork have improved a lot throughout this project. I am grateful to have such amazing team members that we could improve together. Lastly, I learned more about the theme of this project which is Big Data and Artificial Intelligence.

# Reflection
I have gained a lot of knowledge regarding technology and information.This enables me to understand more in this field and will be helpful for me in the future. Besides, I also learned design thinking through the project in this course which will definitely helped a lot when developing or designing product.

In my opinion, I hope that we could have more practical activities for easier understanding. I quite enjoy the PC assemble activity, even it is a quiz but it is fun and could let us have a clearer insight.
